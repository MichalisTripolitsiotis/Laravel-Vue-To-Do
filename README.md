# Laravel & Vue Simple To-do application

My first web application combined with Laravel and Vue JS. From the tutorial (https://github.com/MichalisTripolitsiotis/Vue3Tutorial) I understood the basics regarding Vue and I tried to make an application with Laravel.
Technologies that I used:

- [X] Laravel

- [X] Axios for the HTTP requests
- [X] npm
